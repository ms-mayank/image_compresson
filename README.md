A python project.
An Automated Bulk Image Compression : A python script file which uses Tinypng API and compresses bulk images in a single click.

Create one "original" folder and one "compressed" folder and keep the image compressor.py file where both folder has been created.

Save file.

To Run:
  Add uncompressed image in "original" folder. and Run the python file.
